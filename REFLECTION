# Reflection

## What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem?
I asked Copilot to help me build a basic Instagram-like social media feed using Python and Flask. I started with a single post, then requested features like a like button and comment interface. Later, I asked for support for multiple posts and more interactivity, breaking the problem into manageable steps: backend logic, HTML template, styling, and image handling.

## How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
Initially, I asked for broad features ("create a social media post component"). As I progressed, my questions became more specific ("add multiple posts", "make it more interactive"). I also asked for help with setup and running the app, and clarified requirements as new needs arose.

## What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?
Copilot was able to scaffold the entire Flask app, including backend, templates, and static files, with minimal input. It handled multi-file coordination and even provided step-by-step instructions for running the app. The ability to iteratively improve the app based on feedback was impressive.

## What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?
I learned how easy it is to build interactive web apps with Flask and Jinja templates. I also discovered how to manage multiple posts and user interactions in memory, and how to structure a Flask project for a social media feed.

## What would you do differently if you had to build this again?
I would plan the app structure and features in more detail before starting, and consider using a database for persistent data. I would also explore more advanced interactivity (AJAX, real-time updates) and better error handling. Finally, I would document each step and decision more thoroughly for future reference.
